Release 1.2.5 of Slony-I has the following bug fixes over 1.2.2:

- Fixed issue with xxid C functions - these functions need to be
  defined STRICT so that NULL values don't cause the functions to
  barf.  This has been causing users of PostgreSQL 8.2 to see
  postmasters falling over.

- Several improvements to internal documentation of altperl scripts
