* Documentation
----------------

 - Pull material from Chris Browne's wiki
   <http://cbbrowne.dyndns.info:8741/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Sandbox/SlonyIAdministration>,
   reformat to DocBook, and add this in...

* Backend
----------------

Modify the @NAMESPACE@.logtrigger(namespace, number, keyform) function
so it periodically does a SYNC even if nothing else causes one to be
done.

This amounts to running some equivalent to the code in sync_thread.c:

  -> Start a serializable transaction

  -> Get last value of sl_action_seq

  -> If value has changed, or sync interval timeout has arrived

     -> Generate SYNC event 
                select @NAMESPACE@.createEvent('_@NAMESPACE@', 'SYNC', NULL);

* slonspool
----------------

"Log Spooling" version of slon

This writes data to files rather than connecting to a destination
database.

* named nodes
----------------

Augment slonik to allow users to give nodes symbolic names that may be
used instead of node numbers throughout Slonik.

That permits renaming nodes, and using logical names rather than
(likely) cryptic numbers.
