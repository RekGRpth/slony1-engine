This test involves submitting date and timestamps in various DATESTYLE
forms, and verifying that all load in properly.

Note that it tests several derivations:
- DATE
- TIMESTAMP
- TIMESTAMPTZ
- A domain that derives from TIMESTAMPTZ
- An array of TIMESTAMPTZ values

Both master + slave have slon configuration managed via slon.conf to
verify that the testing framework functions properly for handling this
with both nodes.
