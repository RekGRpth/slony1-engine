test1 is a basic test that replication generally functions.  
  
It creates three simple tables as one replication set, and replicates
them from one database to another.
  
The three tables are of the three interesting types:
  
1.  table1 has a formal primary key

2.  table2 lacks a formal primary key, but has a candidate primary key

It tries replicating a third table, which has an invalid candidate
primary key (columns not defined NOT NULL), which should cause it to
be rejected.  That is done in a slonik TRY {} block.

It also creates...

5.  table4 which has columns of all sorts of vaguely esoteric types to
exercise that points, paths, bitmaps, mac addresses, and inet types
replicate properly.

6.  It does a test of the function generate_sync_event() to make sure
that it works as expected

7.  It does a test of make_function_strict(), a function used in
'UPDATE FUNCTIONS' to change the xxidin() function to be STRICT.

8.  It does a run of UPDATE FUNCTIONS against node 1.  This verifies
that there are at least no syntax errors in the stored function.

9.  It uses a slon.conf file for node #2 to make sure that the logic
of the config file parser gets exercised.
