test1 is a basic test that replication generally functions.  
  
It doesn't try to do anything too terribly fancy: It creates three
simple tables as one replication set, and replicates them from one
database to another.
  
The three tables are of the three interesting types:
  
1.  table1 has a formal primary key

2.  table2 lacks a formal primary key, but has a candidate primary key

3.  table3 has no candidate primary key; Slony-I is expected to
    generate one on its own.

It actually tries replicating a fourth table, which has an invalid
candidate primary key (columns not defined NOT NULL), which should
cause it to be rejected.  That is done in a slonik TRY {} block.
