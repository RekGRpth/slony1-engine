slon-mkservice.sh
-------------------
Create a slon service directory for use with svscan from daemontools.
This uses multilog in a pretty basic way. See logrep for cleverness.
Currently very limited error handling. This probably needs to be
fixed...

It asks for configuration information interactively, if run
interactively.

For non-interactive use, set the following environment variables.
BASEDIR SYSUSR PASSFILE DBUSER HOST PORT DATABASE CLUSTER SLON_BINARY

logrep-mkservice.sh
--------------------

This uses "tail -F" to pull data from Slony-I log files to allow
creating special purpose log files to report specially desired
information.
