- Need to write a "repair_cluster.pl" script that 
  modifies configuration to reflect new configuration,
  dropping and adding paths and listeners.

  This would compare the configuration computed (as in init_cluster)
  with the configuration actually found on some node, add "additional"
  bits, and drop obsolete bits.

- It would seem likely that the function "generate_listen_paths()" in
  init_cluster.pl would be beneficial to port to pl/pgsql, as
  there presently isn't any capability to rebuild the listener
  paths by automatically dropping the old ones.

- At present, the configuration generated by this set of tools is
  fairly fragile.  If just about any sort of error is made, it is
  commonly needful to drop all of the Slony schemas, thereby cleaning
  _everything_ out, and restarting the configuration process from
  scratch.

  That certainly isn't ideal.
