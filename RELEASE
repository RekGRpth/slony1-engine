* Slony-I 2.3 Release Notes

** Significant Changes
   
** Bugs fixed in the course of the release

	These are expected to represent bugs that were previously present,
	not a consequence of problems introduced and subsequently fixed in
	the 2.3 branch.

   - Bug 352 :: Issues with PostgreSQL "head" (what shall become 9.5 or so).  It is pretty usual for #include files to shift a bit and for functions to change arguments a bit.
   - Bug 349 :: Issue with quoting of cluster name - only hit when processing DDL
