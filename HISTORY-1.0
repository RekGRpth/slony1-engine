1.0.1	Bugfix release

  date: 2004/07/07 16:33:39;  author: wieck;
  Critical bugfix. Under some wiered circumstances in the MVCC it is
  possible that there is a gap between xmin and xmax in the snapshot
  but all transactions that fall into that range have already committed.
  In that case, the new_qual did mistakenly use xmin for the qualification
  and thereby lost the replication log rows generated by those
  transactions entirely.
