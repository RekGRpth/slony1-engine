  date: 2004/07/09 13:43:09;  author: wieck;
  Fixed bug causing subscription information not to be copied
  correctly on node initialization.

  Fixed bug. If the event flow configured via listen is different
  from the data flow configured via subscribe set, then the new
  subscriber never started to copy the data.

  Don't check for sync status on copy set if copying from the origin.

  PostgreSQL 7.5 has been renamed to 8.0, make it so that we pass
  8.0 version checks

  date: 2004/08/15 15:43:24;  author: wieck;
  Disabled a listen+unlisten per SYNC processing, that caused
  pg_listener bloat. The pg_listener entry was used to speedup
  failover. The entire node restart mechanism will be redone
  in 1.1.


1.0.1	Bugfix release

  date: 2004/07/07 16:33:39;  author: wieck;
  Critical bugfix. Under some wiered circumstances in the MVCC it is
  possible that there is a gap between xmin and xmax in the snapshot
  but all transactions that fall into that range have already committed.
  In that case, the new_qual did mistakenly use xmin for the qualification
  and thereby lost the replication log rows generated by those
  transactions entirely.
