- Add remote_listen_timeout parameter to slon.conf

This addresses the problem where a slon times out when accessing
sl_event if a node has been out of commission for a long time (several
days)

- Add node numbers to error reports in slonik

If portions of UNINSTALL NODE break, report in the error message which node
it was working on.  That way the gentle user gets an indication as to 
which node 'broke' if the slonik script contained multiple such
requests.

- Applied bug fix for #1538

If cluster has only one node, then remove all events up to the last
SYNC.  That allows the cleanup loop to clear out sl_log_{1/2}.
Otherwise, the log tables will forever bloat until you add a second
node...
