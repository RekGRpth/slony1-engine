Directory src/slon

This directory contains the main replication engine.

STATUS:
	
	Multithreaded framework started.

	Engine reads tables sl_node, sl_path and sl_listen on startup
	and starts 3 local threads (sync, cleanup, listen) as well
	as one thread per remote node. All threads connect to their
	databases and have timer/listen+notify behaviour.

TODO:

 	Read set subscription information on startup.

	Create one local database connection per origin we are subscribing
	data from. A remote SYNC event from that origin will be replicated
	into the local database via that connection.

  local threads:

	SyncThread:		Generate SYNC event if sl_action_seq changes.

	CleanupThread:	Call cleanup procedure and vacuum database.

	EventThread:	Select configuration changes and process them.

  remote threads:

    EventThread:	Exchange confirm information.
					Select new events and process them.
