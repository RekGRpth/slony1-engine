Directory src/slon

This directory contains the main replication engine.

STATUS:
	
	Slon can subscribe to a data set, copy the initial data from
	the provider and sync. That is usually called "replication".

	Slon can forward log information.

	Slon can also subscribe to a set as a cascaded slave and
	change the data provider later on the fly.

TODO:

	All other admin events (especially drop)

	Use forward data for PITR.
