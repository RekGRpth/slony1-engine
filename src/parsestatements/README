scanner.c is a scanner which uses a state machine to walk through a
set of SQL statements and identify where the ends of statements are
(e.g. - relevant ";"'s).

It needs to handle various forms of quoting, notably with "double
quotes", 'single quotes', and $dol$dollar quoting$dol$.

This will need to get integrated into both slon and slonik in order
to split DDL requests being submitted via EXECUTE SCRIPT into
individual statements.
