The 1.1.2 release primarily addresses four issues:

1.  Subscribing to an empty set caused replication to break with
a malformed query on the subscriber. 

2.  During the execution of DDL scripts, all tables will be restored
in order to support cross-schema DDL.

3.  UPDATE FUNCTIONS got fixed to support upgrading from 1.0.6.
