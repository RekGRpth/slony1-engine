- Fixed problem with EXECUTE SCRIPT (EXECUTE ONLY ON = <node>)

  - The script was being executed on too many nodes...

- Added a test script for log shipping

  ... And alter it to add invocation of a DDL script.  This
  allows testing for an event-counting problem in log shipping.

- Changes to support PostgreSQL 8.3 as VARATT_SIZEP has been deprecated

- in xxid.c, changes to support PostgreSQL 8.3 as tuple compression has
  more extensive support

  VARDATA_ANY(PG_DETOAST_DATUM_PACKED((PG_GETARG_DATUM(0))))
  tends to replace
  PG_GETARG_VARLENA(0)
