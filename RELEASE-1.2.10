- Fixed problem with EXECUTE SCRIPT (EXECUTE ONLY ON = <node>)

  - The script was being executed on too many nodes...

- Added a test script for log shipping

  ... And alter it to add invocation of a DDL script.  This
  allows testing for an event-counting problem in log shipping.

- Changes to support PostgreSQL 8.3 as VARATT_SIZEP has been deprecated
