What is Slony-I?

Slony-I is a "master to multiple slaves" replication system with cascading and
faultier.  The big picture for the development of Slony-I is a master-slave
system that includes all features and capabilities needed to replicate large
databases to a reasonably limited number of slave systems.  Slony-I is a
system for data centers and backup sites, where the normal mode of operation
is that all nodes are available. 

Why yet another replication system?

Slony-I was born, with the idea to create a replication system that was not
tied to a specific version of PostgreSQL, and allowed to be started and stopped
on an existing database with out the need for a dump/reload cycle.

What Slony-I is not.

Slony-I is not a network management system. Slony-I does not have any
functionality within it to detect a node failure, or automatically promote a
node to a master or other data origin.  Slony-I is not multi-master; it's not
a connection broker, and it doesn't make you coffee and toast in the morning.

Current Limitations:

Slony-I does not automatically propagate schema changes, nor does it have any
ability to replicate large objects.
