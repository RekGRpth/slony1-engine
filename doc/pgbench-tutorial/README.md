Slony-I pgbench tutorial
========================

This is a 12 step example of using Slony-I with more than just a simple
2-node master-slave setup. The individual 01_... to 12_... scripts have
explanations, what they do, at the top. 

The dbsums.sh script can be used at any time after running step 03 to
verify the consistency of the databases.
