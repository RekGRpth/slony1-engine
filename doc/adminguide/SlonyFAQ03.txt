---++ Cluster name with "-" in it

I tried creating a CLUSTER NAME with a "-" in it.  That didn't work.

Slony-I uses the same rules for unquoted identifiers as the PostgreSQL
main parser, so no, you probably shouldn't put a "-" in your
identifier name.

You may be able to defeat this by putting "quotes" around identifier
names, but it's liable to bite you some, so this is something that is
probably not worth working around.
