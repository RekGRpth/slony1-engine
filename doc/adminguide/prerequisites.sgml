<para>Any platform that can run PostgreSQL should be able to run
<productname/Slony-I/.

<para>The platforms that have received specific testing at the time of
this release are FreeBSD-4X-i368, FreeBSD-5X-i386, FreeBSD-5X-alpha,
osX-10.3, Linux-2.4X-i386 Linux-2.6X-i386 Linux-2.6X-amd64,
<trademark/Solaris/-2.8-SPARC, <trademark/Solaris/-2.9-SPARC, AIX 5.1
and OpenBSD-3.5-sparc64.

<para>There have been reports of success at running
<productname>Slony-I</productname> hosts that are running PostgreSQL
on Microsoft <trademark>Windows</trademark>.  At this time, the
<quote>binary</quote> applications (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> -
<application><link linkend="slonik"> slonik </link></application>,
<application><link linkend="slon"> slon </link></application>) do not
run on <trademark>Windows</trademark>, but a <application><link
linkend="slon"> slon </link></application> running on one of the
Unix-like systems has no reason to have difficulty connect to a
PostgreSQL instance running on <trademark>Windows</trademark>.

<para> It ought to be possible to port <application><link
linkend="slon"> slon </link></application> and <application><link
linkend="slonik"> slonik </link></application> to run on
<trademark>Windows</trademark>; the conspicuous challenge is of having
a POSIX-like <filename>pthreads</filename> implementation for
<application><link linkend="slon"> slon </link></application>, as it
uses that to have multiple threads of execution.  There are reports of
there being a <filename>pthreads</filename> library for
<trademark>Windows</trademark>, so nothing should prevent some
interested party from volunteering to do the port.</para>

<sect2><title> Software needed</title>
<para>
<itemizedlist>
	
<listitem><para> GNU make.  Other make programs will not work.  GNU
make is often installed under the name <command>gmake</command>; this
document will therefore always refer to it by that name. (On
Linux-based systems GNU make is typically the default make, and is
called <command>make</command>) To test to see if your make is GNU
make enter <command>make version</command>.  Version 3.76 or later
will suffice; previous versions may not.

<listitem><para> You need an ISO/ANSI C compiler.  Recent versions of
<application>GCC</application> work.

<listitem><para> You also need a recent version of PostgreSQL
<emphasis>source</emphasis>.  <productname>Slony-I</productname>
depends on namespace support so you must have version 7.3.3 or newer
to be able to build and use <productname>Slony-I</productname>.  Rod
Taylor has <quote>hacked up</quote> a version of
<productname>Slony-I</productname> that works with version 7.2; if you
desperately need that, look for him on the PostgreSQL Hackers mailing
list.  It is not anticipated that 7.2 will be supported by any
official <application><productname>Slony-I</productname></application>
release.

<listitem><para> GNU packages may be included in the standard
packaging for your operating system, or you may need to look for
source code at your local GNU mirror (see <ulink
url="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">
http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html </ulink> for a list) or at <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu"> ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu </ulink> .)

<listitem><para> If you need to obtain PostgreSQL source, you can
download it from your favorite PostgreSQL mirror.  See <ulink
url="http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-www.html">
http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-www.html </ulink> for a list.
</itemizedlist>

<para>Also check to make sure you have sufficient disk space.  You
will need approximately 5MB for the source tree during build and
installation.

<sect2><title> Getting <productname>Slony-I</productname>
Source</title>

<para>You can get the <productname>Slony-I</productname> source from
<ulink url="http://developer.postgresql.org/~wieck/slony1/download/">
http://developer.postgresql.org/~wieck/slony1/download/</ulink>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2><title> Time Synchronization</title>

<para> All the servers used within the replication cluster need to
have their Real Time Clocks in sync. This is to ensure that slon
doesn't error with messages indicating that slave is already ahead of
the master during replication.  We recommend you have ntpd running on
all nodes, with subscriber nodes using the <quote>master</quote>
provider node as their time server.

<para> It is possible for <productname>Slony-I</productname> to
function even in the face of there being some time discrepancies, but
having systems <quote>in sync</quote> is usually pretty important for
distributed applications.

<para> See <ulink url="http://www.ntp.org/"> www.ntp.org </ulink> for
more details about NTP (Network Time Protocol).

</sect2>

<sect2><title> Network Connectivity</title>

<para>It is necessary that the hosts that are to replicate between one
another have <emphasis>bidirectional</emphasis> network communications
to the PostgreSQL instances.  That is, if node B is replicating data
from node A, it is necessary that there be a path from A to B and from
B to A.  It is recommended that all nodes in a
<productname>Slony-I</productname> cluster allow this sort of
bidirection communications from any node in the cluster to any other
node in the cluster.

<para>Note that the network addresses need to be consistent across all
of the nodes.  Thus, if there is any need to use a
<quote>public</quote> address for a node, to allow remote/VPN access,
that <quote>public</quote> address needs to be able to be used
consistently throughout the <productname>Slony-I</productname>
cluster, as the address is propagated throughout the cluster in table
<envar>sl_path</envar>.

<para>A possible workaround for this, in environments where firewall
rules are particularly difficult to implement, may be to establish SSH
Tunnels that are created on each host that allow remote access through
IP address 127.0.0.1, with a different port for each destination.

<para> Note that <application>slonik</application> and the
<application>slon</application> instances need no special connections
or protocols to communicate with one another; they just need to be
able to get access to the <application>PostgreSQL</application>
databases, connecting as a <quote>superuser</quote>.

<para> An implication of the communications model is that the entire
extended network in which a <productname>Slony-I</productname> cluster
operates must be able to be treated as being secure.  If there is a
remote location where you cannot trust the
<productname>Slony-I</productname> node to be considered
<quote>secured,</quote> this represents a vulnerability that adversely
the security of the entire cluster.  In effect, the security policies
throughout the cluster can only be considered as stringent as those
applied at the <emphasis>weakest</emphasis> link.  Running a
full-blown <productname>Slony-I</productname> node at a branch
location that can't be kept secure compromises security for the
cluster.

<para>In the future plans is a feature whereby updates for a
particular replication set would be serialized via a scheme called
<quote>log shipping.</quote> The data stored in sl_log_1 and sl_log_2
would be written out to log files on disk.  These files could be
transmitted in any manner desired, whether via scp, FTP, burning them
onto DVD-ROMs and mailing them, or even by recording them on a USB
<quote>flash device</quote> and attaching them to birds, allowing a
sort of <quote>avian transmission protocol.</quote> This will allow
one way communications so that <quote>subscribers</quote> that use log
shipping would have no need for access to other
<productname>Slony-I</productname> nodes.
