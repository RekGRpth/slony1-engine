---+++ Database Schema Changes (DDL)

When changes are made to the database schema, e.g. adding fields to a table, it is necessary for this to be handled rather carefully, otherwise different nodes may get rather deranged because they disagree on how particular tables are built.

If you pass the changes through Slony-I via the EXECUTE SCRIPT (slonik) / ddlscript(set,script,node) (stored function), this allows you to be certain that the changes take effect at the same point in the transaction streams on all of the nodes.

It's worth making a couple of comments on "special things" about EXECUTE SCRIPT:

	* The script must not contain transaction BEGIN or END statements, as the script is already executed inside a transaction.  In PostgreSQL version 8, the introduction of nested transactions may change this requirement somewhat, but you must still remain aware that the actions in the script are wrapped inside a transaction.

	* If there is _anything_ broken about the script, or about how it executes on a particular node, this will cause the slon daemon for that node to panic and crash.	If you restart the node, it will, more likely than not, try to *repeat* the DDL script, which will, almost certainly, fail the second time just as it did the first time.  I have found this scenario to lead to a need to go to the "master" node to delete the event to stop it from continuing to fail.

	* For slon to, at that point, "panic" is probably the _correct_ answer, as it allows the DBA to head over to the database node that is broken, and manually fix things before cleaning out the defective event and restarting slon.  You can be certain that the updates made _after_ the DDL change on the provider node are queued up, waiting to head to the subscriber.  You don't run the risk of there being updates made that depended on the DDL changes in order to be correct.

Unfortunately, this nonetheless implies that the use of the DDL facility is somewhat fragile and dangerous.  Making DDL changes should not be done in a sloppy or cavalier manner.  If your applications do not have fairly stable SQL schemas, then using Slony-I for replication is likely to be fraught with trouble and frustration.
