<sect1 id="usingslonik"> <title>Using Slonik</title>

<para> It's a bit of a pain writing <application>Slonik</application>
scripts by hand, particularly as you start working with &slony1;
clusters that may be comprised of increasing numbers of nodes and
sets.  Some problems that have been noticed include the following:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> If you are using &slony1; as a
<quote>master/slave</quote> replication system with one
<quote>master</quote> node and one <quote>slave</quote> node, it may
be sufficiently mnemonic to call the <quote>master</quote> node 1 and
the <quote>slave</quote> node 2.</para>

<para> Unfortunately, as the number of nodes increases, the mapping of
IDs to nodes becomes way less obvious, particularly if you have a
cluster where the origin might shift from node to node over
time.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Similarly, if there is only one replication set, it's
fine for that to be <quote>set 1,</quote> but if there are a
multiplicity of sets, the numbering involved in using set numbers may
grow decreasingly intuitive.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> People have observed that
<application>Slonik</application> does not provide any notion of
iteration.  It is common to want to create a set of similar <xref
linkend="stmtstorepath"> entries, since, in most cases, hosts will
likely access a particular server via the same host name or IP
address.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Users seem interested in wrapping everything possible
in <command>TRY</command> blocks, which is regrettably
<emphasis>less</emphasis> useful than might be imagined...</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> These have assortedly pointed to requests for such enhancements
as:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> Named nodes, named sets</para>

<para> Unfortunately, the use of naming nearly turns into a need for
an <quote>ESP protocol</quote>, as <application>slonik</application>
would need to <emphasis>start</emphasis> by determining the (possibly
in flux) set of mappings between node names and node
IDs. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Looping and control constructs</para>

<para> It seems to make little sense to create a fullscale parser as
Yet Another Little Language grows into a rather larger one.  There are
plenty of scripting languages out there that can be used to construct
Slonik scripts; it is unattractive to force yet another one on people.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para> There are several ways to work around these issues that have
been seen <quote>in the wild</quote>:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Some sort of text rewriting system such as M4 may be
used to map mnemonic object names onto the perhaps-less-intuitive
numeric arrangement.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Embedding generation of slonik inside shell
scripts</para>

<para> The test bed found in the <filename>src/ducttape</filename>
directory takes this approach.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> The <xref linkend="altperl"> use Perl code to
generate Slonik scripts.</para>

<para> You define the cluster as a set of Perl objects; each script
walks through the Perl objects as needed to satisfy whatever it is
supposed to do.  </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<sect1 id="slonikm4"><title> Using m4 to rewrite slonik scripts </title>

<para> This needs to be prefaced with something of a warning, from the
GNU M4 documentation:

<warning><para> Some people found `m4' to be fairly addictive. They
first use `m4' for simple problems, then take bigger and bigger
challenges, learning how to write complex `m4' sets of macros along
the way. Once really addicted, users pursue writing of sophisticated
`m4' applications even to solve simple problems, devoting more time
debugging their `m4' scripts than doing real work. Beware that `m4'
may be dangerous for the health of compulsive
programmers.</para></warning></para>

<para> This being said, <application>m4</application> has three
significant merits over other text rewriting systems (such as
<application>cpp</application>, the C preprocessor):

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Like slonik, m4 uses <quote>#</quote> to indicate
comments, with the result that it may be quietly used to do rewrites
on slonik scripts.</para>

<para> Using <application>cpp</application> would require changing
over to use C or C++ style comments.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> <application> m4 </application> is reasonably
ubiquitous, being available in environments like
<productname>Solaris</productname> and <productname>AIX</productname>
even when they do not have compiler tools for C available.  Its
presence is commonly mandated by the presence of
<productname>Sendmail</productname>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> A <emphasis>potential</emphasis> merit over
<application>cpp</application> is that <application> m4</application>
can do more than just rewrite symbols.  It has control structures, can
store data in variables, and can loop.</para>

<para> Of course, down that road lies the addictions warned of above,
as well as the complexity challenges of
<filename>sendmail.cf</filename>.  As soon as you discover you need
things like loops and variables, it is quite likely that you want to
write a slonik generator in your favorite scripting language, whether
that be Bourne Shell, Perl, or Tcl.  Fans of more esoteric languages like
Icon, Snobol, or Scheme will have to fight their own battles to get
those deemed to be reasonable choices for <quote>best
practices.</quote></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>

<sect2><title> An m4 example </title>

<para> Without further ado, here is an example where you set up a
central file, <filename> cluster.m4 </filename> containing some M4
rewrite rules:
<programlisting>
define(`node_srvrds005', `1')
define(`node_srvrds004', `4')
define(`node_srvrds003', `3')
define(`node_srvrds007', `78')
define(`ds501', `501')
</programlisting></para>

<para> In view of those node name definitions, you may write a Slonik
script to initialize the cluster as follows, <filename>setup_cluster.slonik</filename>:

<programlisting>
node node_srvrds005 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';
node node_srvrds004 admin conninfo 'dsn=bar';
node node_srvrds003 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';
node node_srvrds007 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';
node ds501 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';

create cluster	info (id=node_srvrds005);
store node (id=node_srvrds004, comment='Node on ds004', spool='f');
store node (id=node_srvrds003, comment='Node on ds003', spool='f');
store node (id=node_srvrds007, comment='Node on ds007', spool='t');
store node (id=ds501, comment='Node on ds-501', spool='f');
</programlisting></para>

<para> You then run the rewrite rules on the script, thus:</para>
<para>
<command> % m4 cluster.m4 setup_cluster.slonik </command></para>
<para> And receive the following output:
<programlisting>
node 1 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';
node 4 admin conninfo 'dsn=bar';
node 3 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';
node 78 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';
node 501 admin conninfo 'dsn=foo';

create cluster  info (id=1);
store node (id=4, comment='Node on ds004', spool='f');
store node (id=3, comment='Node on ds003', spool='f');
store node (id=78, comment='Node on ds007', spool='t');
store node (id=501, comment='Node on ds-501', spool='f');
</programlisting></para>

<para> This makes no attempt to do anything <quote>smarter</quote>,
such as to try to create the nodes via a loop that maps across a list
of nodes.  As mentioned earlier, if you wish to do such things, it is
highly preferable to do this by using a scripting language like the
Bourne Shell or Perl.

<sect1 id="slonikshell"><title> Embedding Slonik in Shell Scripts </title>

<para> As mentioned earlier, there are numerous &slony1; test scripts
in <filename>src/ducttape</filename> that embed the generation of
Slonik inside the shell script.</para>

<para> They mostly <emphasis> don't </emphasis> do this in a terribly
sophisticated way.  Typically, they use the following sort of
structure:

<programlisting>
DB1=slony_test1
DB2=slony_test2
slonik <<_EOF_
	cluster name = T1;
	node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB1';
	node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB2';

	try {
		table add key (node id = 1, fully qualified name = 'public.history');
	}
	on error {
		exit 1;
	}

	try {
		create set (id = 1, origin = 1, comment = 'Set 1 - pgbench tables');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 1, fully qualified name = 'public.accounts',
			comment = 'Table accounts');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 2, fully qualified name = 'public.branches',
			comment = 'Table branches');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 3, fully qualified name = 'public.tellers',
			comment = 'Table tellers');
		set add table (set id = 1, origin = 1,
			id = 4, fully qualified name = 'public.history',
			key = serial, comment = 'Table accounts');
	}
	on error {
		exit 1;
	}
_EOF_
</programlisting></para>

<para> A more sophisticated approach might involve defining some
common components, notably the <quote>preamble</quote> that consists
of the <xref linkend="clustername"> <xref linkend="admconninfo">
commands that are common to every Slonik script, thus:

<programlisting>
CLUSTER=T1
DB1=slony_test1
DB2=slony_test2
PREAMBLE="cluster name = $CLUSTER
node 1 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB1';
node 2 admin conninfo = 'dbname=$DB2';
"
</programlisting></para>

<para> The <envar>PREAMBLE</envar> value could then be reused over and
over again if the shell script invokes <command>slonik</command>
multiple times. </para>

<para> It also becomes simple to assign names to sets and nodes:

<programlisting>
origin=1
subscriber=2
mainset=1
slonik <<_EOF_
$PREAMBLE
try {
    table add key (node id = $origin, fully qualified name = 'public.history');
} on error {
    exit 1;
}
try {
	create set (id = $mainset, origin = $origin, comment = 'Set $mainset - pgbench tables');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 1, fully qualified name = 'public.accounts',
		comment = 'Table accounts');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 2, fully qualified name = 'public.branches',
		comment = 'Table branches');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 3, fully qualified name = 'public.tellers',
		comment = 'Table tellers');
	set add table (set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
		id = 4, fully qualified name = 'public.history',
		key = serial, comment = 'Table accounts');
} on error {
	exit 1;
}
_EOF_
</programlisting></para>

<para> The script might be further enhanced to loop through the list
of tables as follows:

<programlisting>
# Basic configuration
origin=1
subscriber=2
mainset=1
# List of tables to replicate
TABLES="accounts branches tellers history"
ADDTABLES=""
tnum=1
for table in `echo $TABLES`; do
  ADDTABLES="$ADDTABLES
   set add table ($set id = $mainset, origin = $origin,
   id = $tnum, fully qualified name = 'public.$table',
   comment = 'Table $tname');
"
  let "tnum=tnum+1"
done
slonik <<_EOF_
$PREAMBLE
try {
    table add key (node id = $origin, fully qualified name = 'public.history');
} on error {
    exit 1;
}
try {
	create set (id = $mainset, origin = $origin, comment = 'Set $mainset - pgbench tables');
$ADDTABLES
} on error {
	exit 1;
}
_EOF_
</programlisting></para>

<para> That is of somewhat dubious value if you only have 4 tables,
but eliminating errors resulting from enumerating large lists of
configuration by hand will make this pretty valuable for the larger
examples you'll find in <quote>real life.</quote></para>

<para> You can do even more sophisticated things than this if your
scripting language supports things like:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> <quote>Record</quote> data structures that allow assigning things in parallel</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Functions, procedures, or subroutines, allowing you to implement
useful functionality once, and then refer to it multiple times within a script</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Some sort of <quote>module import</quote> system so that common functionality
can be shared across many scripts</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>

<para> If you can depend on having <ulink
	url="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html"> Bash</ulink>, <ulink
	url="http://www.zsh.org/"> zsh</ulink>, or <ulink
	url="http://www.kornshell.com/"> Korn shell</ulink> available, well,
those are all shells with extensions supporting reasonably
sophisticated data structures and module systems.  On Linux, Bash is
fairly ubiquitous; on commercial <trademark>UNIX</trademark>, Korn shell is
fairly ubiquitous; on BSD, <quote>sophisticated</quote> shells are an
option rather than a default.</para>

<para> At that point, it makes sense to start looking at other
scripting languages, of which Perl is the most ubiquitous, being
widely available on Linux, <trademark>UNIX</trademark>, and BSD.

<sect1 id="noslonik"><title> Not Using Slonik - Bare Metal &slony1;
Functions </title>

<para> There are cases where it may make sense to directly use the
stored functions that implement the various pieces of &slony1;.
Slonik doesn't do terribly much <quote>magic;</quote> it is common for
Slonik commands to simply involve deciding on a node at which to apply
a command, and then submit a SQL query consisting of a call to one of
the &slony1; stored functions.</para>

<para> The developers of &slony1; anticipate that interested parties
may wish to develop graphical tools as an alternative to Slonik; it
would be entirely appropriate in such cases to submit configuration
requests directly via the stored functions.

<para> When debugging problems in <quote>troubled</quote> &slony1;
clusters, it has also occasionally proven useful to use the stored
functions.  This has been particularly useful for cases where
<envar>sl_listen</envar> configuration has been broken, and events
have not been propagating properly.  The <quote>easiest</quote> fix
was to:</para>

<para> <command> select
_slonycluster.droplisten(li_origin,li_provider,li_receiver) from
_slonycluster.sl_listen;</command></para>

<para> <command> select _slonycluster.storelisten(pa_server,
pa_server, pa_client) from _slonycluster.sl_path;</command></para>

<para> The result of this set of queries is to regenerate
<emphasis/and propagate/ the listen paths.  By running the main
<function/ _slonycluster.storelisten()/ function,
<command/STORE_LISTEN/ events are raised to cause the listen paths to
propagate to the other nodes in the cluster.

<para> If there was a <emphasis/local/ problem on one node, and you
didn't want the updates to propagate (this would be an unusual
situation; you almost certainly want to fix things
<emphasis/everywhere/), the queries would instead be:

<para> <command> select
slonycluster.droplisten_int(li_origin,li_provider,li_receiver) from
_slonycluster.sl_listen;</command></para>

<para> <command> select _slonycluster.storelisten_int(pa_server,
pa_server, pa_client) from _slonycluster.sl_path;</command></para>

<para> If you are planning to add &slony1; support to other tools
(<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - adding replication support to something
like <ulink url="http://www.pgadmin.org/"> <productname>pgAdmin
III</productname> </ulink>), you need to be clear on where various
functions need to be called.  The normal <quote>protocol</quote> is
thus:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> The <quote>main</quote> function
(<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> - without the <command>_int</command>
suffix) is called on a <quote>relevant</quote> node in the &slony1;
cluster.

</itemizedlist>
