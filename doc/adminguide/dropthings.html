run the following three queries, on each host:

need to change to the ID of the table you want to have go away.&#13;</P
><P
>You'll have to run these three queries on all of the nodes,
preferably firstly on the origin node, so that the dropping of this
propagates properly.  Implementing this via a <A
HREF="app-slonik.html#SLONIK"
>slonik </A
> statement with a new <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN

do that.  Submitting the three queries using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE SCRIPT</TT

could do that; see <A
HREF="ddlchanges.html"
> Database Schema Changes</A

database and submit the queries by hand.&#13;</P
