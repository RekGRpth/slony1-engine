<para>You should have obtained the Slony-I source from the previous step. Unpack it.</para>

<screen>
gunzip slony.tar.gz;
tar xf slony.tar
</screen>

<para> This will create a directory Slony-I under the current
directory with the Slony-I sources.  Head into that that directory for
the rest of the installation procedure.</para>

<sect2><title> Configuration</title>

<para>The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the source tree
for your system.  This is done by running the configure script.  Configure
needs to know where your PostgreSQL source tree is, this is done with the
--with-pgsourcetree= option.</para></sect2>

<sect2><title> Example</title>

<screen>
./configure --with-pgsourcetree=/usr/local/src/postgresql-7.4.3
</screen>

<para>This script will run a number of tests to guess values for
various dependent variables and try to detect some quirks of your
system.  Slony-I is known to need a modified version of libpq on
specific platforms such as Solaris2.X on SPARC this patch can be found

<sect2><title> Build</title>

<para>To start the build process, type

<screen>
gmake all
</screen></para>

<para> Be sure to use GNU make; on BSD systems, it is called gmake; on
Linux, GNU make is typically the native "make", so the name of the
command you type in may vary somewhat. The build may take anywhere
from a few seconds to 2 minutes depending on how fast your hardware is
at compiling things.  The last line displayed should be</para>

<para> <command> All of Slony-I is successfully made.  Ready to

<sect2><title> Installing Slony-I</title>

<para> To install Slony-I, enter

<command>
gmake install
</command></para>

<para>This will install files into postgresql install directory as
specified by the <option>--prefix</option> option used in the PostgreSQL

into that area.  Normally you need to do this either as root or as the
postgres user.
