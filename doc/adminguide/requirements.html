> All the servers used within the replication cluster need to
have their Real Time Clocks in sync. This is to ensure that slon
doesn't error with messages indicating that slave is already ahead of
the master during replication.  We recommend you have ntpd running on
all nodes, with subscriber nodes using the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"master"</SPAN
>
provider node as their time server.</P

function even in the face of there being some time discrepancies, but
having systems <SPAN

><P
>It is necessary that the hosts that are to replicate between one
another have <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>bidirectional</I
></SPAN
> network communications
to the PostgreSQL instances.  That is, if node B is replicating data
from node A, it is necessary that there be a path from A to B and from
B to A.  It is recommended that all nodes in a
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> cluster allow this sort of
bidirection communications from any node in the cluster to any other
node in the cluster.</P
><P
>Note that the network addresses need to be consistent across all
of the nodes.  Thus, if there is any need to use a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"public"</SPAN
> address for a node, to allow remote/VPN access,
that <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"public"</SPAN
> address needs to be able to be used
consistently throughout the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
>
cluster, as the address is propagated throughout the cluster in table
<TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>sl_path</TT
>.</P
><P
>A possible workaround for this, in environments where firewall
rules are particularly difficult to implement, may be to establish SSH
Tunnels that are created on each host that allow remote access through
IP address 127.0.0.1, with a different port for each destination.</P
><P
> Note that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slonik</SPAN
> and the
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>slon</SPAN
> instances need no special connections
or protocols to communicate with one another; they just need to be
able to get access to the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
databases, connecting as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"superuser"</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> An implication of the communications model is that the entire
extended network in which a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> cluster
operates must be able to be treated as being secure.  If there is a
remote location where you cannot trust the
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> node to be considered
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"secured,"</SPAN
> this represents a vulnerability that adversely
the security of the entire cluster.  In effect, the security policies
throughout the cluster can only be considered as stringent as those
applied at the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>weakest</I
></SPAN
> link.  Running a
full-blown <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> node at a branch
location that can't be kept secure compromises security for the
cluster.</P
><P
>In the future plans is a feature whereby updates for a
particular replication set would be serialized via a scheme called
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"log shipping."</SPAN
> The data stored in sl_log_1 and sl_log_2
would be written out to log files on disk.  These files could be
transmitted in any manner desired, whether via scp, FTP, burning them
onto DVD-ROMs and mailing them, or even by recording them on a USB
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"flash device"</SPAN
> and attaching them to birds, allowing a
sort of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"avian transmission protocol."</SPAN
> This will allow
one way communications so that <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"subscribers"</SPAN
> that use log
shipping would have no need for access to other
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony-I</SPAN
> nodes.</P
