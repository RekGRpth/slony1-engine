<sect1 id="plainpaths"><title> &slony1; Path Communications</title>

<para> &slony1; uses &postgres; DSNs in two contexts to establish
access to databases:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <xref linkend="admconninfo"> - controlling how a
<xref linkend="slonik"> script accesses the various nodes.

<para> These connections are the ones that go from your
<quote/administrative workstation/ to all of the nodes in a &slony1;
cluster.

<para> It is <emphasis/vital/ that you have connections from the
central location where you run <xref linkend="slonik"> 
to each and every node in the network.  These connections are only
used briefly, to submit the few <acronym/SQL/ requests required to
control the administration of the cluster.

<para> Since these communications paths are only used briefly, it may
be quite reasonable to <quote>hack together</quote> temporary
connections using <link linkend="tunnelling">SSH tunnelling</link>.

<listitem><para> <xref linkend="stmtstorepath"> - controlling how
<xref linkend="slon"> daemons communicate with remote nodes.  These
paths are stored in <xref linkend="table.sl-path">.

<para> You forcibly <emphasis>need</emphasis> to have a path between
each subscriber node and its provider; other paths are optional, and
will not be used unless a listen path in <xref
linkend="table.sl-listen">. is needed that uses that particular path.

</itemizedlist>

<para> The distinctions and possible complexities of paths are not
normally an issue for people with simple networks where all the hosts
can see one another via a comparatively <quote>global</quote> set of
network addresses.  In contrast, it matters rather a lot for those
with complex firewall configurations, nodes at multiple locations, and
the issue where nodes may not be able to all talk to one another via a
uniform set of network addresses.</para>

<para> There is also room for discussion of SSH tunnelling here...</para>
