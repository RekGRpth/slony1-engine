<para> <productname>Slony-I</productname></para>

<para> Basically need to discuss what STORE PATHs are about, and
distinguish them from the admin conninfo entries in the slonik
preamble.</para>

<para> This isn't an issue for people with simple networks; it matters
for those with complex firewall configurations, nodes at multiple
locations, and the issue where nodes may not be able to all talk to
one another at a uniform set of network addresses.</para>

<para> There is also room for discussion of SSH tunnelling here...</para>
