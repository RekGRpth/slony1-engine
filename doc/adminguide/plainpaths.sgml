<sect1 id="plainpaths"><title> &slony1; Path Communications</title>

<para> &slony1; uses &postgres; DSNs in two contexts to establish
access to databases:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <link linkend="admconninfo"> <command> ADMIN CONNINFO
</command> </link> - controlling how a <link linkend="slonik"> slonik
</link> script accesses the various nodes.

<para> These connections are the ones that go from your
<quote/administrative workstation/ to all of the nodes in a &slony1;
cluster.

<para> It is <emphasis/vital/ that you have connections from the
central location where you run <link linkend="slonik"> slonik </link>
to each and every node in the network.  These connections are only
used briefly, to submit the few <acronym/SQL/ requests required to
control the administration of the cluster.

<para> Since these communications paths are only used briefly, it may
be quite reasonable to <quote>hack together</quote> temporary
connections using <link linkend="tunnelling">SSH tunnelling</link>.

<listitem><para> <link linkend="stmtstorepath"> <command> STORE PATH
</command> </link> - controlling how <link linkend="slon"> slon
</link> daemons communicate with remote nodes.  These paths are stored
in <link linkend="table.sl-path"> <envar>sl_path</envar> </link>. 

<para> You forcibly <emphasis>need</emphasis> to have a path between
each subscriber node and its provider; other paths are optional, and
will not be used unless a listen path in <link
linkend="table.sl-listen"> <envar>sl_listen</envar> </link>. is needed
that uses that particular path.

</itemizedlist>

<para> The distinctions and possible complexities of paths are not
normally an issue for people with simple networks where all the hosts
can see one another via a comparatively <quote>global</quote> set of
network addresses.  In contrast, it matters rather a lot for those
with complex firewall configurations, nodes at multiple locations, and
the issue where nodes may not be able to all talk to one another via a
uniform set of network addresses.</para>

<para> There is also room for discussion of SSH tunnelling here...</para>
