Note to would-be authors:  If you wish to add additional sections, please feel free.  It would be preferable if new material maintained the prefix "Slony" as my backup scripts look specifically for that file prefix.

This set of documentation will, once it is more complete, be transformed into DocBook and added into the Slony-I documentation tree.  As a result, please contribute only if you are willing for it to be added there under the traditional BSD-style license used by PostgreSQL...
