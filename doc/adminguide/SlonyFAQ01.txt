---++ I looked for the _clustername namespace, and it wasn't there.

If the DSNs are wrong, then slon instances can't connect to the nodes.

This will generally lead to nodes remaining entirely untouched.

Recheck the connection configuration.  By the way, since slon links to
libpq, you could have password information stored in $HOME/.pgpass,
partially filling in right/wrong authentication information there.
