---++ Slony-I: cannot add table to currently subscribed set 1

 I tried to add a table to a set, and got the following message:

<verbatim>
	Slony-I: cannot add table to currently subscribed set 1
</verbatim>

You cannot add tables to sets that already have subscribers.

The workaround to this is to create ANOTHER set, add the new tables to
that new set, subscribe the same nodes subscribing to "set 1" to the
new set, and then merge the sets together.
