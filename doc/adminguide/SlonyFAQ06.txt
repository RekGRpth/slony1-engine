---++ Slonik fails - cannot load PostgreSQL library - PGRES_FATAL_ERROR load '$libdir/xxid';

 When I run the sample setup script I get an error message similar
to:

<verbatim>
<stdin>:64: PGRES_FATAL_ERROR load '$libdir/xxid';  - ERROR:  LOAD:
could not open file '$libdir/xxid': No such file or directory
</verbatim>

Evidently, you haven't got the xxid.so library in the $libdir directory that the PostgreSQL instance is using.  Note that the Slony-I components need to be installed in the PostgreSQL software installation for _each and every one_ of the nodes, not just on the "master node."

This may also point to there being some other mismatch between the PostgreSQL binary instance and the Slony-I instance.  If you compiled
Slony-I yourself, on a machine that may have multiple PostgreSQL builds "lying around," it's possible that the slon or slonik binaries
are asking to load something that isn't actually in the library directory for the PostgreSQL database cluster that it's hitting.

Long and short: This points to a need to "audit" what installations of PostgreSQL and Slony you have in place on the machine(s).
Unfortunately, just about any mismatch will cause things not to link up quite right.  See also SlonyFAQ02 concerning threading issues on Solaris
