<sect1 id="monitoring"> <title/Monitoring/

<para>Here are some of things that you may find in your
<productname/Slony-I/ logs, and explanations of what they mean.

<sect2><title/CONFIG notices/

<para>These entries are pretty straightforward. They are informative
messages about your configuration.

<para>Here are some typical entries that you will probably run into in
your logs:

<screen>
CONFIG main: local node id = 1
CONFIG main: loading current cluster configuration
CONFIG storeNode: no_id=3 no_comment='Node 3'
CONFIG storePath: pa_server=5 pa_client=1 pa_conninfo="host=127.0.0.1 dbname=foo user=postgres port=6132" pa_connretry=10
CONFIG storeListen: li_origin=3 li_receiver=1 li_provider=3
CONFIG storeSet: set_id=1 set_origin=1 set_comment='Set 1'
CONFIG main: configuration complete - starting threads
</screen>

<sect2><title>DEBUG Notices</title>

<para>Debug notices are always prefaced by the name of the thread that
the notice originates from. You will see messages from the following
threads:

<screen>
localListenThread: This is the local thread that listens for events on the local node.
remoteWorkerThread_X: The thread processing remote events.
remoteListenThread_X: Listens for events on a remote node database.
cleanupThread: Takes care of things like vacuuming, cleaning out the confirm and event tables, and deleting logs.
syncThread: Generates sync events.
</screen>

<para> WriteMe: I can't decide the format for the rest of this. I
think maybe there should be a "how it works" page, explaining more
about how the threads work, what to expect in the logs after you run a
slonik command...
