<para>Here are some of things that you may find in your Slony logs, and explanations of what they mean. 

<sect1><title/CONFIG notices/

<para>These entries are pretty straightforward. They are informative messages about your configuration. 

<para>Here are some typical entries that you will probably run into in your logs:

<para><command>
CONFIG main: local node id = 1
CONFIG main: loading current cluster configuration
CONFIG storeNode: no_id=3 no_comment='Node 3'
CONFIG storePath: pa_server=5 pa_client=1 pa_conninfo="host=127.0.0.1 dbname=foo user=postgres port=6132" pa_connretry=10
CONFIG storeListen: li_origin=3 li_receiver=1 li_provider=3
CONFIG storeSet: set_id=1 set_origin=1 set_comment='Set 1'
CONFIG main: configuration complete - starting threads
</command>

<sect1><title/DEBUG Notices/

<para>Debug notices are always prefaced by the name of the thread that the notice originates from. You will see messages from the following threads:

<para><command>
localListenThread: This is the local thread that listens for events on the local node.
remoteWorkerThread_X: The thread processing remote events.
remoteListenThread_X: Listens for events on a remote node database.
cleanupThread: Takes care of things like vacuuming, cleaning out the confirm and event tables, and deleting logs.
syncThread: Generates sync events.
</command>

<para> WriteMe: I can't decide the format for the rest of this. I
think maybe there should be a "how it works" page, explaining more
about how the threads work, what to expect in the logs after you run a
slonik command...
