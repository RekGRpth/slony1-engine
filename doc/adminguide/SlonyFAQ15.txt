---++ The slons spent the weekend out of commission [for some reason], and it's taking a long time to get a sync through.

You might want to take a look at the sl_log_1/sl_log_2 tables, and do
a summary to see if there are any really enormous Slony-I transactions
in there.  Up until at least 1.0.2, there needs to be a slon connected
to the master in order for SYNC events to be generated.

If none are being generated, then all of the updates until the next
one is generated will collect into one rather enormous Slony-I
transaction.

Conclusion: Even if there is not going to be a subscriber around, you
_really_ want to have a slon running to service the "master" node.

Some future version (probably 1.1) may provide a way for SYNC counts
to be updated on the master by the stored function that is invoked by
the table triggers.
