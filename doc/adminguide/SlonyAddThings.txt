---++ Adding Things to Replication

You may discover that you have missed replicating things that you wish you were replicating.

This can be fairly easily remedied.

You cannot directly use SET ADD TABLE or SET ADD SEQUENCE in order to add tables and sequences to a replication set that is presently replicating; you must instead create a new replication set.  Once it is identically subscribed (e.g. - the set of subscribers is _identical_ to that for the set it is to merge with), the sets may be merged together using MERGE SET.

Up to and including 1.0.2, there is a potential problem where if MERGE_SET is issued when other subscription-related events are pending, it is possible for things to get pretty confused on the nodes where other things were pending.  This problem was resolved in 1.0.5.
