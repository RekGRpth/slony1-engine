<indexterm><primary>trigger handling</primary></indexterm>

<para> In &postgres; version 8.3, new functionality was added where
triggers and rules may have their behaviour altered via <command>ALTER
TABLE</command>, to specify  the following alterations:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> <command> DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE ALWAYS TRIGGER trigger_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> DISABLE RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE REPLICA RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <command> ENABLE ALWAYS RULE rewrite_rule_name</command>  </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para> A new GUC variable, <envar>session_replication_role</envar>
controls whether the session is in <envar>origin</envar>,
<envar>replica</envar>, or <envar>local</envar> mode, which then, in
combination with the above enabling/disabling options, controls
whether or not the trigger function actually runs. </para>

<para> We may characterize when triggers fire, under &slony1;
replication, based on the following table; the same rules apply to
&postgres; rules.</para>

<table id="triggerbehaviour"> <title> Trigger Behaviour </title>
<tgroup cols="7">

<para> There are, correspondingly, now, several ways in which &slony1;
interacts with this.  Let us outline those times that are interesting:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> Before replication is set up,
<emphasis>every</emphasis> database starts out in
<quote>origin</quote> status, and, by default, all triggers are of the
<command>ENABLE TRIGGER</command> form, so they all run, as is normal
in a system uninvolved in replication. </para> </listitem>

<listitem><para> When a &slony1; subscription is set up, on the origin
node, both the <function>logtrigger</function> and
<function>denyaccess</function> triggers are added, the former being
enabled, and running, the latter being disabled, so it does not
run. </para>

<para> From a locking perspective, each <xref
linkend="stmtsetaddtable"> request will need to briefly take out an
exclusive lock on each table as it attaches these triggers, which is
much the same as has always been the case with &slony1;. </para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> On the subscriber, the subscription process will add
the same triggers, but with the polarities <quote>reversed</quote>, to
protect data from accidental corruption on subscribers.  </para>

<para> From a locking perspective, again, there is not much difference
from earlier &slony1; behaviour, as the subscription process, due to
running <command>TRUNCATE</command>, copying data, and altering table
schemas, requires <emphasis>extensive</emphasis> exclusive table
locks, and the changes in trigger behaviour do not change those
requirements.  </para>


</listitem>

<listitem><para>If you restore a backup of a Slony-I node (taken by pg_dump or 
any other method), and drop the Slony-I namespace, this now cleanly removes 
all Slony-I components, leaving the database, including its schema, 
in a <quote>pristine</quote>, consistent fashion, ready for whatever use may 
be desired. 
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> &rddlchanges; is now performed in quite a different
way: rather than altering each replicated table to <quote>take it out
of replicated mode</quote>, &slony1; instead simply shifts into the
<command>local</command> status for the duration of this event.  </para>

<para> On the origin, this deactivates the
<function>logtrigger</function> trigger. </para>

<para> On each subscriber, this deactivates the
<function>denyaccess</function> trigger. </para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para> At the time of invoking <xref linkend="stmtmoveset">
against the former origin, &slony1; must transform that node into a
subscriber, which requires dropping the <function>lockset</function>
triggers, disabling the <function>logtrigger</function> triggers, and
enabling the <function>denyaccess</function> triggers. </para>

<para> At about the same time, when processing <xref
linkend="stmtmoveset"> against the new origin, &slony1; must transform
that node into an origin, which requires disabling the formerly active
<function>denyaccess</function> triggers, and enabling the
<function>logtrigger</function> triggers. </para>

<para> From a locking perspective &slony1; will need to take out exclusive
locks  to disable and enable the respective
triggers.
</para>

</listitem>

<listitem><para> Similarly to <xref linkend="stmtmoveset">, <xref
linkend="stmtfailover"> transforms a subscriber node into an origin,
which requires disabling the formerly active
<function>denyaccess</function> triggers, and enabling the
<function>logtrigger</function> triggers.  The locking implications
are again, much the same, requiring an exclusive lock on each such
table.  </para> </listitem>

</itemizedlist>
