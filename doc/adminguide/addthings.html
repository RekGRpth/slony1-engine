>You may discover that you have missed replicating things that
you wish you were replicating.&#13;</P
><P
>This can be fairly easily remedied.&#13;</P
><P
>You cannot directly use <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SET ADD TABLE</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SET
ADD SEQUENCE</TT
> in order to add tables and sequences to a replication
set that is presently replicating; you must instead create a new
replication set.  Once it is identically subscribed (e.g. - the set of
subscribers is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>identical</I
></SPAN
> to that for the set it is to merge
with), the sets may be merged together using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>MERGE SET</TT
>.&#13;</P
><P
>Up to and including 1.0.2, there is a potential problem where if
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>MERGE_SET</TT
> is issued when other subscription-related events
are pending, it is possible for things to get pretty confused on the
nodes where other things were pending.  This problem was resolved in
1.0.5.&#13;</P
><P
>It is suggested that you be very deliberate when adding such
things.  For instance, submitting multiple subscription requests for a
particular set in one Slonik script often turns out quite badly.  If
it is truly necessary to automate this, you'll probably want to submit
<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>WAIT FOR EVENT</TT
> requests in between subscription requests in
order that the Slonik script wait for one subscription to complete
processing before requesting the next one.&#13;</P
><P
>But in general, it is likely to be easier to cope with complex
node reconfigurations by making sure that one change has been
successfully processed before going on to the next.  It's way easier
to fix one thing that has broken than the interaction of five things
that have broken.
