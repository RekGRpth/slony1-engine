<article id="addingthings"> <title/ Adding Things to Replication/

<para>You may discover that you have missed replicating things that you wish you were replicating.

<para>This can be fairly easily remedied.

<para>You cannot directly use SET ADD TABLE or SET ADD SEQUENCE in
order to add tables and sequences to a replication set that is
presently replicating; you must instead create a new replication set.
Once it is identically subscribed (e.g. - the set of subscribers is
<emphasis/identical/ to that for the set it is to merge with), the
sets may be merged together using MERGE SET.

<para>Up to and including 1.0.2, there is a potential problem where if MERGE_SET is issued when other subscription-related events are pending, it is possible for things to get pretty confused on the nodes where other things were pending.  This problem was resolved in 1.0.5.

<para>It is suggested that you be very deliberate when adding such things.  For instance, submitting multiple subscription requests for a particular set in one Slonik script often turns out quite badly.  If it is truly necessary to automate this, you'll probably want to submit WAIT FOR EVENT requests in between subscription requests in order that the Slonik script wait for one subscription to complete processing before requesting the next one.

<para>But in general, it is likely to be easier to cope with complex node reconfigurations by making sure that one change has been successfully processed before going on to the next.  It's way easier to fix one thing that has broken than the interaction of five things that have broken.
