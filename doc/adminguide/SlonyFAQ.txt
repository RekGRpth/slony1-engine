---++ Frequently Asked Questions

Not all of these are "frequently asked;" some represent _trouble found that seemed worth documenting_.

Note that numerous of these items are version-specific, describing how to deal with error conditions that are dealt with automatically by later releases.  In particular, version 1.0.5 resolved numerous issues where changing replication configuration didn't quite work entirely right.  Many of these items should therefore ultimately get reorganized to indicate version specificity.  There are quite enough issues with 1.0.2 that people should probably prefer to use 1.0.5 unless there's very special reason to stay with 1.0.2 for the time being.
