Release 1.2.1 of Slony-I has the following improvements over 1.2.0:

- Added a SYNC slonik command to allow requesting a SYNC event.
  This is a more useful thing to wait for than a SUBSCRIBE SET.

- MERGE SET now refuses to be applied if a subscriber has not
  yet confirmed post-subscription events

- Added a SLEEP slonik command to allow writing code that tells
  the script to pause for some number of seconds

- Fixed a concurrency problem where if you had multiple log
  shipped nodes, the threads processing them shared a single
  file descriptor as well as other variables.

- If a child process exits with return code of 0, that means it
  *asked* to exit, presumably because configuration changed that it
  needs to reload.  In that case, there's no need to wait 10s before
  restarting the thread; we should restart the thread immediately.

  This causes operations like MOVE SET to run ~10s faster per
  subscription change.

- Added a script, tools/release_checklist.sh, which performs some of
  the release checklist checks, such as verifying that the Slony-I
  version number (e.g. - 1.2.1) is consistent across various places
  that need to reference it.

- altperl scripts have had "listen path" generation removed as that is
  handled automatically as clusters are built.

- Fixed some portability problems in tools/launch_cluster.sh

- Added a new script, tools/search_logs.sh, meant to search hourly for
  errors in slon logs and warn an administrator about them.
