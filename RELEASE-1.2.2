Release 1.2.2 of Slony-I has the following bug fixes over 1.2.1:

- SGML tagging fixes to allow docs to be generated on Fedora

- Fixes to altperl scripts (init cluster, store node) so they would
  properly generate STORE PATH requests (which had broken when STORE
  LISTEN code was removed)

- If PostgreSQL version is 8.1 or greater, we can use pg_config
  sharedir. Otherwise we will resort to the default guessing mode.

- Some makefile hygenic fixes

- Added \n to a number of log requests

- Fix to UPDATE FUNCTIONS which did not consider versions 1.1.5/1.1.6
  to be members of the 1.1 stream...

- Removed some confusing NOTICEs concerning management of partial
  indexes on sl_log_1 and sl_log_2.

- Close file descriptors upon running slon_terminate_worker() so that
  we don't run out of file descriptors

- Added in sleep(10) requests in several places where attempts to
  access the database in the main thread fails; this means that, for
  instance, the main DB is down, the slon doesn't simply sit there
  continually attempting to reconnect, as many times per second as it
  can.
