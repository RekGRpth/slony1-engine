I need to get the full, voluminous release notes completed, but there
are a few pointedly tasty improvements in store:

1.  Compatibility with 8.1.  There was a sort of "interlock" that
abused pg_listener in order to make sure that each node was being
managed by one and only one slon process.  Functionality of
Async_Unlisten() changed in 8.1, so we had to change strategy to use a
new custom table to manage this.

2.  Greatly Improved SUBSCRIBE SET performance.  Indices are
temporarily detached during the COPY statements, and then reattached
and reindexed, which, in principle, should mean that subscribing a set
should be a bit faster than restoring from pg_dump (with Slony-I all
the indices are regenerated together, so there should be benefits from
the data already being in cache).

3.  The New Generation test scripts have been added in, which should
make it easier to run tests.

4.  Man pages for slon, slonik, as well as all the slonik commands can
now be generated.

5.  There is official Debian packaging under way, in the
"experimental" area.

6.  A fairly large number of minor bugs that have been reported have
been fixed.


*** OUTSTANDING ISSUE WITH PostgreSQL 8.1 ***

PostgreSQL 8.1 is quite a lot more strict about what UTF-8 mappings of
Unicode characters it accepts as compared to version 8.0.

If you intend to use Slony-I to update an older database to 8.1, and
might have invalid UTF-8 values, you may be for an unpleasant
surprise.

Let us suppose we have a database running 8.0, encoding in UTF-8.
That database will accept the sequence '\060\242' as UTF-8 compliant,
even though it is really not.

If you replicate into a PostgreSQL 8.1 instance, it will complain
about this, either at subscribe time, where Slony-I will complain
about detecting an invalid Unicode sequence during the COPY of the
data, which will prevent the subscription from proceeding, or, upon
adding data, later, where this will hang up replication fairly much
irretrievably.  (You could hack on the contents of sl_log_1, but
that's *really* unattractive...)

There have been discussions as to what might be done about this.  No
compelling strategy has yet emerged, as all are unattractive.

If you are using Unicode with PostgreSQL 8.0, you run a considerable
risk of corrupting data.  

If you use replication for a one-time conversion, there is a risk of
failure due to the issues mentioned earlier; if that happens, it
appears likely that the best answer is to fix the data on the 8.0
system, and retry.

In view of the risks, running replication between versions seems to be
something you should not keep running any longer than is necessary to
migrate to 8.1.
