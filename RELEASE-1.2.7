- Add remote_listen_timeout parameter to slon.conf

This addresses the problem where a slon times out when accessing
sl_event if a node has been out of commission for a long time (several
days)

- Resolve bug #1623

In this bug, big "action lists" that need to get compressed could cause
a logging printf to blow up.  Changed the logging level so that detail
is only shown at level 4, which won't bite people by default.

- UNINSTALL NODE failures now show node # in slonik error messages

If a user ran several UNINSTALL NODE requests in a single slonik
script, and one of them broke, you'd have no ready way to tell which
node this failed on.  Added code to report the node # where it failed.

- Added test to test1 for function generate_sync_event() and make_function_strict

- Added "v81" files (for slony1_base.v81.sql, slony1_funcs.v81.sql,
xxid.v81.sql), necessary to support 8.1 "ALTER FUNCTION ... STRICT";

- Fixed quoting problem in generate_sync_event()

- Added functionality to UPDATE FUNCTIONS to make xxidin() function
STRICT; the absence of this caused postmaster to fall over when
processing MOVE SET event in PG v8.2

- Added documentation of an issue surrounding NULLABLE columns to the
log analysis chapter of the admin guide and to the UPGRADING docs.
