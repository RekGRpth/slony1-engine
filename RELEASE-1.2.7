- Add remote_listen_timeout parameter to slon.conf

This addresses the problem where a slon times out when accessing
sl_event if a node has been out of commission for a long time (several
days)

- Resolve bug #1623

In this bug, big "action lists" that need to get compressed could cause
a logging printf to blow up.  Changed the logging level so that detail
is only shown at levels 4/5, which won't bite people by default.
