Differences from 1.2 stream

- Removal of TABLE ADD KEY

- It drops all support for databases prior to Postgres version 8.3.

This is required because we now make use of new functionality in
Postgres, namely the trigger and rule support for session replication
role. As of now, every node (origin/subscriber/mixed) can be dumped with
pg_dump and result in a consistent snapshot of the database.

- Still need alterTableRestore() for the upgrade from 1.2.x to 2.0.
upgradeSchema() will restore the system catalog to a consistent
state and define+configure the new versions of the log and deny_access
triggers. 

- Fix EXECUTE SCRIPT so that it records the ev_seqno for WAIT FOR EVENT
and make sure all DDL is executed in session_replication_role "local"
on the origin as well as all subscribers. This will cause the slony
triggers to ignore all DML statements while user triggers follow the
regular configuration options for ENABLE [REPLICA/ALWAYS] or DISABLE.

- Let the logshipping files also switch to session_replication_role =
"replica" or "local" (for DDL).

- Sequence tracking becomes enormously less expensive; rather than
polling *ALL* sequence values for each and every SYNC, the slon
stores the last value, and only records entries in sl_seqlog when
the value changes from that last value.  If most sequences are
relatively inactive, they won't require entries in sl_seqlog very
often.
